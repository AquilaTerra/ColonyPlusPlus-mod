# ColonyPlusPlus-mod

ColonyPlusPlus is the first mod for [Colony Survival](http://store.steampowered.com/app/366090/Colony_Survival/) to use the C# modding API. We're working closely with the developers of the game to get the modding API fleshed out, while also adding some much needed content to the game. This repository represents the underlying C# code for the mod.

At the moment, the mod mainly sits as a base framework for other mods, while adding a few food items and recipes. In the future we plan to add over 200 items to the game with recipes, as well as balancing a lot of the game. Check out the [changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColonyPlusPlus/ColonyPlusPlus/master/ColonyPlusPlus/colonyplusplus-changelog.txt) for the latest changes.

At the moment we're still using a few assets from the [Smooth Operator](https://mods.curse.com/texture-packs/minecraft/230576-smooth-operator) Minecraft texture pack! We'll be replacing those as soon as possible!

ColonyPlusPlus-Mod can be used as a base for making your own mods, but please remove the blocks we have added within your own mod to avoid conflicts from players using both ColonyPlusPlus and your own mod.
